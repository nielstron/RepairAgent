The failing test case 'aiffFilesAreNoTARs' is triggering the bug due to 'created an input stream for a non-archive' error. I should analyze the code around these lines to understand the issue better.",

The catch block at line 246 catches all exceptions, which could lead to incorrect behavior when dealing with non-archive inputs.
