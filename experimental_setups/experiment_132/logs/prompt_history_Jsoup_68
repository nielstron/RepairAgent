You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. get_info: Gets info about a specific bug in a specific project, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
2. run_tests: Runs the test cases of the project being analyzed, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
3. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (name: string, index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
4. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(name:string, index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int)
5. express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (hypothesis: string)

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.
## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):
No info was collected about the bug so far. You can get more info about the bug by running the commands: get_info and run_tests.

## Hypothesis about the bug:
No hypothesis made yet.

## Read lines:
No files have been read so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## The list of commands you have executed so far:

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "I have information about the bug, but I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.",
"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

        assertEquals(200, doc.select("span").size());
        assertEquals(1, doc.select("p").size());
  }
}



## Hypothesis about the bug:
- (Current hypothesis) The excessive nesting of 'span' tags in the test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' is causing a StackOverflowError.

## Read lines:
No files have been read so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## The list of commands you have executed so far:
run_tests , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case org.jsoup.parser.HtmlParserTest::testHandlesDeepSpans resulted in a java.lang.StackOverflowError. I should extract the code of the failing test case to understand the input and expected output.'
express_hypothesis , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' creates a StringBuilder with 200 '<span>' tags, leading to a StackOverflowError. The test checks if the document contains 200 'span' elements and 1 'p' element. The issue seems to be the excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing the StackOverflowError.'
## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.
## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }

8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... }

## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.

}



## Hypothesis about the bug:
- (Current hypothesis) The excessive nesting of 'span' tags in the test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' is causing a StackOverflowError.

## Read lines:
No files have been read so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## The list of commands you have executed so far:
run_tests , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case org.jsoup.parser.HtmlParserTest::testHandlesDeepSpans resulted in a java.lang.StackOverflowError. I should extract the code of the failing test case to understand the input and expected output.'
express_hypothesis , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' creates a StringBuilder with 200 '<span>' tags, leading to a StackOverflowError. The test checks if the document contains 200 'span' elements and 1 'p' element. The issue seems to be the excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing the StackOverflowError.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The hypothesis about the excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing a StackOverflowError has been expressed. Now, I need to collect information to fix the bug.'
get_classes_and_methods , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The code snippet from TokeniserState.java doesn't seem directly related to the issue of excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing a StackOverflowError. I should explore other parts of the codebase to gather more relevant information.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The file path provided seems to be a directory instead of a specific file. I need to provide a specific file path to gather information about the classes and methods within the codebase.'
## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.

You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.
## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):

### Test cases results:
Command run_tests returned: There are 1 failing test cases, here is the full log of failing cases:
--- org.jsoup.parser.HtmlParserTest::testHandlesDeepSpans
java.lang.StackOverflowError
### The code of the failing test cases:
Extracting test code from file HtmlParserTest.java returned: Command extract_test_code returned: public void testHandlesDeepSpans() {

        assertEquals(200, doc.select("span").size());
        assertEquals(1, doc.select("p").size());
  }
}



## Hypothesis about the bug:
- (Current hypothesis) The excessive nesting of 'span' tags in the test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' is causing a StackOverflowError.

## Read lines:
No files have been read so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## The list of commands you have executed so far:
run_tests , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case org.jsoup.parser.HtmlParserTest::testHandlesDeepSpans resulted in a java.lang.StackOverflowError. I should extract the code of the failing test case to understand the input and expected output.'
express_hypothesis , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The failing test case 'testHandlesDeepSpans' creates a StringBuilder with 200 '<span>' tags, leading to a StackOverflowError. The test checks if the document contains 200 'span' elements and 1 'p' element. The issue seems to be the excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing the StackOverflowError.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The hypothesis about the excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing a StackOverflowError has been expressed. Now, I need to collect information to fix the bug.'
get_classes_and_methods , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The code snippet from TokeniserState.java doesn't seem directly related to the issue of excessive nesting of 'span' tags causing a StackOverflowError. I should explore other parts of the codebase to gather more relevant information.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The file path provided seems to be a directory instead of a specific file. I need to provide a specific file path to gather information about the classes and methods within the codebase.'
get_classes_and_methods , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The file path provided for HtmlParser.java does not exist. I should try a different file path to gather information about the classes and methods within the codebase.'
get_classes_and_methods , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The previous file path was a directory. I should provide a specific file path to gather information about the classes and methods within the codebase.'
get_classes_and_methods , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The file path 'src/main/java/org/jsoup/parser/HtmlParser.java' does not exist. I should try a different file path to gather information about the classes and methods within the codebase.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'I have gathered information about the classes and methods within the Parser.java file. Now, I need to analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The code snippet from the Parser.java file provides the initial structure of the Parser class. I should continue to analyze the relevant sections of the code to identify the potentially faulty areas.'
## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "I have information about the bug, but I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.",
"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT:** DO NOT OUTPUT ANY ENGLISH TEXT WITH YOUR JSON RESPONSE.

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.
## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;

"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT:** DO NOT OUTPUT ANY ENGLISH TEXT WITH YOUR JSON RESPONSE.

You are AutoDebugV0.6.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Jsoup and bug index 68.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer) where name is the name of the project and index is the index of the bug.
2. search_code_base: This function will seach in all java files for a provided list of keywords, it will return a dictionary where for each file    it will give the classes and within the classes the methods names and within the methods names a list of matched keywords against the method name    the returned results looks structurly like this { file_name: { class_name: { method_name: [...list of matched keywords...] } } }     this function is useful to search for already implemented methods that could be reused or to look for similar code to get an idea on how    to implement a certain functionality. This function does not return the code itself but just the matched methods names that contain at least one of the keywords., params: (name: string, index: integer, key_words: list)
3. get_classes_and_methods: This function allows you to get all classes and methods names within a file.    It returns a dictinary where keys are classes names and values are list of methods names    The file path should start from source or src directory depending on the project, you whould know which one is it after you execute get_info command, params: (name: string, index: integer, file_path: string)
4. extract_similar_functions_calls: For a provided buggy code snippet in 'code_snippet' within the file 'file_path', this function extracts similar function calls. This aids in understanding how functions are utilized in comparable code snippets, facilitating the determination of appropriate parameters to pass to a function., params: (name: string, index: string, file_path: string, code_snippet: string)
 5.write_fix: Use this command to implement the fix you came up with. Write a list of lines into a file to replace all lines between startline and endline. The test cases are run automatically after running the changes. The changes are reverted automatically if the the test cases fail., params: (name: string, index: integer, filepath: string, startline: integer, endline: integer, lines_list: list[string])

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.
## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }
