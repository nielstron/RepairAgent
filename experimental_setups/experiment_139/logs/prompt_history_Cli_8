----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.6.3, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Cli and bug index 8.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (project_name: string, bug_index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
2.  express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (hypothesis: string). By calling this command, you also automatically switch to the state 'collect information to fix the bug'. Before delving into fixing, you should always express a hypothesis.
3. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(project_name:string, bug_index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int) where project_name is the name of the project and bug_index is the index of the bug
## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):
### Bug info:
Root cause in triggering tests:
 - org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped
   --> junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: single line padded text 2 expected:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[

The bug is located at exactly these lines numbers or around them: (the format is file-name#line-number# line-code):
org/apache/commons/cli/HelpFormatter.java#812#            pos = findWrapPos(text, width, nextLineTabStop);

The following is the list of buggy methods:
org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatter.renderWrappedText(Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;IILjava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;,1

### Test cases results:
There are 1 failing test cases, here is the full log of failing cases:
--- org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: single line padded text 2 expected:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[
                       ] has form YYYY[MM[DD...> but was:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[] has form YYYY[MM[DD...>
	at org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest.testPrintWrapped(HelpFormatterTest.java:96)


## Hypothesis about the bug:
No hypothesis made yet.

## Read lines:
No files have been read so far.

## The list of emplementations of some methods in the code base:
No extracted methods so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## Functions calls extracted based on snippets of code and target files:
No similar functions  calls were extracted.

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "I have information about the bug, but I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.",
"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT:** DO NOT OUTPUT ANY ENGLISH TEXT WITH YOUR JSON RESPONSE.

You have, so far, executed, 0 commands and suggested 0 fixes. You have 40 commands left. However, you need to suggest 4 fixes before consuming all the left commands.

## The list of emplementations of some methods in the code base:
No extracted methods so far.

## Suggested fixes:
This is the list of suggested fixes so far but none of them worked:
No fixes were suggested yet.

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## Functions calls extracted based on snippets of code and target files:
No similar functions  calls were extracted.

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "I have information about the bug, but I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.",
"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT:** DO NOT OUTPUT ANY ENGLISH TEXT WITH YOUR JSON RESPONSE.

You have, so far, executed, 3 commands and suggested 0 fixes. You have 37 commands left. However, you need to suggest 4 fixes before consuming all the left commands.

--------------- ASSISTANT ----------------

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.6.3, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Cli and bug index 8.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (project_name: string, bug_index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
2.  express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (hypothesis: string). By calling this command, you also automatically switch to the state 'collect information to fix the bug'. Before delving into fixing, you should always express a hypothesis.
3. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(project_name:string, bug_index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int) where project_name is the name of the project and bug_index is the index of the bug
## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):
### Bug info:
Root cause in triggering tests:

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.6.3, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.
------------------ USER ------------------
## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the Bug: Execute test cases and get info to systematically identify and isolate the bug within the project Cli and bug index 8.
2. Perform code Analysis: Analyze the lines of code associated with the bug to discern and comprehend the potentially faulty sections.
3. Try simple Fixes: Attempt straightforward remedies, such as altering operators, changing identifiers, modifying numerical or boolean literals, adjusting function arguments, or refining conditional statements. Explore all plausible and elementary fixes relevant to the problematic code.
4. Try complex Fixes: In instances where simple fixes prove ineffective, utilize the information gathered to propose more intricate solutions aimed at resolving the bug.
5. Iterative Testing: Repeat the debugging process iteratively, incorporating the insights gained from each iteration, until all test cases pass successfully.
## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (project_name: string, bug_index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
2.  express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (hypothesis: string). By calling this command, you also automatically switch to the state 'collect information to fix the bug'. Before delving into fixing, you should always express a hypothesis.
3. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(project_name:string, bug_index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int) where project_name is the name of the project and bug_index is the index of the bug
## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):
### Bug info:
Root cause in triggering tests:
 - org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped
   --> junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: single line padded text 2 expected:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[

The bug is located at exactly these lines numbers or around them: (the format is file-name#line-number# line-code):
org/apache/commons/cli/HelpFormatter.java#812#            pos = findWrapPos(text, width, nextLineTabStop);

The following is the list of buggy methods:
org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatter.renderWrappedText(Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;IILjava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;,1

### Test cases results:
There are 1 failing test cases, here is the full log of failing cases:
--- org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped
junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: single line padded text 2 expected:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[
                       ] has form YYYY[MM[DD...> but was:<...TE[-DATE] where DATE[] has form YYYY[MM[DD...>
	at org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest.testPrintWrapped(HelpFormatterTest.java:96)
### The code of the failing test cases:
Extracting test code from file org.apache.commons.cli.HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped returned: Command extract_test_code returned: The filepath org/apache/commons/cli/HelpFormatterTest::testPrintWrapped does not exist.

## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.
## Commands
You have access to the following commands (EXCLUSIVELY):
1. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (project_name: string, bug_index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
2.  express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (hypothesis: string). By calling this command, you also automatically switch to the state 'collect information to fix the bug'. Before delving into fixing, you should always express a hypothesis.
3. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(project_name:string, bug_index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int) where project_name is the name of the project and bug_index is the index of the bug
## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

What follows are sections of the most important information you gathered so far about the current bug.        Use the following info to suggest a fix for the buggy code:
## Info about the bug (bug report summary):

## Executed search queries within the code base:
No search queries executed so far.

## Functions calls extracted based on snippets of code and target files:

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.


Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
```
Here is an example of command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "I have information about the bug, but I need to run the test cases to understand the bug better.",
"command": {
"name": "run_tests",
"args": {
"name": "Chart",
"index": 1
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT:** DO NOT OUTPUT ANY ENGLISH TEXT WITH YOUR JSON RESPONSE.

You have, so far, executed, 6 commands and suggested 0 fixes. You have 34 commands left. However, you need to suggest 4 fixes before consuming all the left commands.
