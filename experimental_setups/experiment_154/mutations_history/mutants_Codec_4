Each dictionary contains the following keys:\n    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.\n    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.\n        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.\n    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.\n    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.\n        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.\nHere is an example:\n[\n    # changes in file 1\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",\n        "insertions": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 175,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\\n",\n                    "    // ... more new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 180,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        "deletions": [179, 183],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 179,\n                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 185,\n                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    # changes in file 2\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",\n        "insertions": [],\n        "deletions": [],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 203,\n                "modified_line": "    days = 0\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 307,\n                "modified_line": "    super()\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:\n- Hint 1: Think of mutating comparision operators, e.g, < to >= and == to != ...\n    Original: if x < 10:\n    Fix: if x >= 10:\n- Hint 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible)\n    Original: result = add(x, y)\n    Fix: result = add(5, 8)\n    \n    Original: x = y + 1\n    Fix:  x = 1\n- Hint 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, allXXX to anyXXX and minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)\n    Original: all_elements_valid = True\n    Fix: any_elements_valid = True\n- Hint 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding \'and\' / \'or\' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of \'and\'/ \'or\' parts)\n    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):\n    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):\n    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):\n- Hint 5: if my patch consist only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard my patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead\n    Orginal: \'// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug\'\n    Fix: pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n- Hint 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code. For example when the info about the bug mention #NEED_MORE_CODE, you should consider adding more lines at the given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.\nExample:\n     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {\n        min = Math.min(minimum, v);\n+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here\n        }\n    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {\n+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here\n        maximum = Math.max(max, u); \n        }\n\n\n\nTask for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines. Respect the fix format, only change values (never touch keys). Put the mutants in a list like this: [mutant1, mutant2,..., mutant30].

Each dictionary contains the following keys:\n    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.\n    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.\n        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.\n    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.\n    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.\n        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.\nHere is an example:\n[\n    # changes in file 1\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",\n        "insertions": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 175,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\\n",\n                    "    // ... more new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 180,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        "deletions": [179, 183],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 179,\n                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 185,\n                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    # changes in file 2\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",\n        "insertions": [],\n        "deletions": [],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 203,\n                "modified_line": "    days = 0\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 307,\n                "modified_line": "    super()\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:\n- Hint 1: Think of mutating comparision operators, e.g, < to >= and == to != ...\n    Original: if x < 10:\n    Fix: if x >= 10:\n- Hint 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible)\n    Original: result = add(x, y)\n    Fix: result = add(5, 8)\n    \n    Original: x = y + 1\n    Fix:  x = 1\n- Hint 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, allXXX to anyXXX and minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)\n    Original: all_elements_valid = True\n    Fix: any_elements_valid = True\n- Hint 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding \'and\' / \'or\' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of \'and\'/ \'or\' parts)\n    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):\n    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):\n    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):\n- Hint 5: if my patch consist only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard my patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead\n    Orginal: \'// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug\'\n    Fix: pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n- Hint 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code. For example when the info about the bug mention #NEED_MORE_CODE, you should consider adding more lines at the given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.\nExample:\n     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {\n        min = Math.min(minimum, v);\n+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here\n        }\n    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {\n+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here\n        maximum = Math.max(max, u); \n        }\n\n\n\nTask for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines.

Each dictionary contains the following keys:\n    "file_name": A string indicating the path or name of the file to be modified.\n    "insertions": A list of dictionaries representing insertions in the file. Each insertion dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.\n        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.\n    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.\n    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file. Each modification dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number to be modified.\n        "modified_line": A string representing the modified content for that line.\nHere is an example:\n[\n    # changes in file 1\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Week.java",\n        "insertions": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 175,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... new lines to insert ...\\n",\n                    "    // ... more new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 180,\n                "new_lines": [\n                    "    // ... additional new lines ...\\n"\n                ]\n            }\n        ],\n        "deletions": [179, 183],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 179,\n                "modified_line": "    if (dataset == null) {\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 185,\n                "modified_line": "    int seriesCount = dataset.getColumnCount();\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    # changes in file 2\n    {\n        "file_name": "org/jfree/data/time/Day.java",\n        "insertions": [],\n        "deletions": [],\n        "modifications": [\n            {\n                "line_number": 203,\n                "modified_line": "    days = 0\\n"\n            },\n            {\n                "line_number": 307,\n                "modified_line": "    super()\\n"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]Here are some hints that might help you in suggesting good mutations:\n- Hint 1: Think of mutating comparision operators, e.g, < to >= and == to != ...\n    Original: if x < 10:\n    Fix: if x >= 10:\n- Hint 2: Think of replacing variables with explicit values (when possible)\n    Original: result = add(x, y)\n    Fix: result = add(5, 8)\n    \n    Original: x = y + 1\n    Fix:  x = 1\n- Hint 3: Consider changing some tokens partially, e.g, allXXX to anyXXX and minXXX to maxXXX startXXX to endXXX, vice versa and so on... (consider all possibilities)\n    Original: all_elements_valid = True\n    Fix: any_elements_valid = True\n- Hint 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding \'and\' / \'or\' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of \'and\'/ \'or\' parts)\n    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):\n    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):\n    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):\n- Hint 5: if my patch consist only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard my patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead\n    Orginal: \'// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug\'\n    Fix: pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n- Hint 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code. For example when the info about the bug mention #NEED_MORE_CODE, you should consider adding more lines at the given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.\nExample:\n     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {\n        min = Math.min(minimum, v);\n+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here\n        }\n    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {\n+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here\n        maximum = Math.max(max, u); \n        }\n\n\n\nTask for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines.

Each insertion dictionary includes:\n        "line_number": An integer indicating the line number where the insertion should occur.\n        "new_lines": A list of strings representing the new lines to be inserted.\n    "deletions": A list of integers representing line numbers to be deleted from the file.\n    "modifications": A list of dictionaries representing modifications in the file.

(consider all possibilities)\n    Original: all_elements_valid = True\n    Fix: any_elements_valid = True\n- Hint 4: Think of making conditions more complex (by adding \'and\' / \'or\' operators and the corresponding part) or less complex (by removing some of \'and\'/ \'or\' parts)\n    Original: if (x > 0 and y < 5):\n    More complex condition: if (x > 0 and y < 5 and z == 10):\n    Less complex condition: if (x > 0):\n- Hint 5: if my patch consist only of adding a comment or modifying a line into a comment, you should discard my patch and try to suggest mutation of the buggy line(s) of code instead\n    Orginal: \'// Modify the logic for finding wrap position and padding text here to address the bug\'\n    Fix: pos = findWrapPos(text, width, 0);\n- Hint 6: in some cases you will be required to insert new lines of code. For example when the info about the bug mention #NEED_MORE_CODE, you should consider adding more lines at the given location. Usually, the code around the insertion location give you an idea about the lines to insert. Also the type of assertion failure.\nExample:\n     if (!Double.isNaN(v)) {\n        min = Math.min(minimum, v);\n+       max = Math.max(maximum, v); // insertion happened here\n        }\n    if (!Double.isNaN(u)) {\n+       minimum = Math.min(min, u);// insertion happened here\n        maximum = Math.max(max, u); \n        }\n\n\n\nTask for assistant:  generate 30 mutants of the target buggy lines.
