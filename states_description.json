    "trying out candidate tests": "## Current state\n trying out candidate tests: While in this state, your objective is to propose tests for the bug and assess the outcomes of the implemented test cases. If your solution effectively reproduces the bug, you can consider the goal accomplished. Alternatively, you may choose to remain in this state and propose additional tests and write them using the command 'write_test', transition to the state of 'collect information to reproduce the bug' or shift to the state of 'collect information to understand the bug'.",
    
    "collect information to reproduce the bug": "## Current state\n collect information to reproduce the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and reproducing the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting tests by calling the command write_test.",
    
    "collect information to understand the bug": "## Current state\n collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where."
