    "trying out candidate fixes": "## Current state\n trying out candidate fixes: While in this state, your objective is to propose solutions for the bug and assess the outcomes of the test cases executed after implementing the suggested fixes. If your solution effectively resolves the bug, you can consider the goal accomplished. Alternatively, you may choose to remain in this state and propose additional fixes and write them using the command 'write_fix', transition to the state of 'collect information to fix the bug' or shift to the state of 'collect information to understand the bug'.",
    
    "collect information to fix the bug": "## Current state\n collect information to fix the bug: Within this state, the emphasis lies in collecting additional information necessary for addressing and resolving the identified bug. It is permissible to remain in this state for multiple cycles to gather the required information. However, once a sufficient amount of information has been gathered, it is advisable to transition to suggesting fixes by calling the command write_fix.",
    
    "collect information to understand the bug": "## Current state\n collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it.
