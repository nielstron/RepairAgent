You are AutoDebugV0.5.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.

Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.

## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the bug within the project "Cli" (index of bug = 8),running test cases will help you to achieve this first goal
2. Analyze the lines of code related to the bug and explain what you think is the buggy part
3. Try simple fixes at first, for example operator change, change identifier used, change numerical or boolean literal, change value of function arguments, change if condition by reversing it, making it more specific or even less specific... Try all possible simple stupid fixes that are relevant to the buggy code.
4. When simple fixes do not work, use the information you gathered to suggest more complex fixes
5. Repeat the process till all the test cases pass

## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.

## Commands
1. get_info: Gets info about a specific bug in a specific project, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
2. run_tests: Runs the test cases of the project being analyzed, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
3. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (name: string, index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
4. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(name:string, index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int)
5. express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (your_hypothesis: string)

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.5.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.

Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.

## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the bug within the project "Cli" (index of bug = 8),running test cases will help you to achieve this first goal
2. Analyze the lines of code related to the bug and explain what you think is the buggy part
3. Try simple fixes at first, for example operator change, change identifier used, change numerical or boolean literal, change value of function arguments, change if condition by reversing it, making it more specific or even less specific... Try all possible simple stupid fixes that are relevant to the buggy code.
4. When simple fixes do not work, use the information you gathered to suggest more complex fixes
5. Repeat the process till all the test cases pass

## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.

## Commands
1. get_info: Gets info about a specific bug in a specific project, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
2. run_tests: Runs the test cases of the project being analyzed, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
3. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (name: string, index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
4. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(name:string, index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int)
5. express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (your_hypothesis: string)

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

Length: 3037 tokens; 6 messages
----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
You are AutoDebugV0.5.0, You are an AI assistant specialized in fixing bugs in Java code. 
You will be given a buggy project, and your objective is to autonomously understand and fix the bug.
You have three states, which each offer a unique set of commands,
 * 'collect information to understand the bug', where you gather information to understand a bug;
 * 'collect information to fix the bug', where you gather information to fix the bug;
 * 'trying out candidate fixes', where you suggest bug fixes that will be validated by a test suite.
.

Your decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.

## Goals
For your task, you must fulfill the following goals:
1. Locate the bug within the project "Cli" (index of bug = 8),running test cases will help you to achieve this first goal
2. Analyze the lines of code related to the bug and explain what you think is the buggy part
3. Try simple fixes at first, for example operator change, change identifier used, change numerical or boolean literal, change value of function arguments, change if condition by reversing it, making it more specific or even less specific... Try all possible simple stupid fixes that are relevant to the buggy code.
4. When simple fixes do not work, use the information you gathered to suggest more complex fixes
5. Repeat the process till all the test cases pass

## Current state
 collect information to understand the bug: In this phase, the primary objective is to locate and understand the bug and the reason behind it. However, upon accumulating a satisfactory level of understanding, you should make your hypothesis about what is wrong and where.

## Commands
1. get_info: Gets info about a specific bug in a specific project, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
2. run_tests: Runs the test cases of the project being analyzed, params: (name: string, index: integer). This command can only be executed once.
3. extract_test_code: This function allows you to extract the code of the failing test cases which will help you understand the test case that led to failure for example by looking at the assertions and the given input and expected output, params: (name: string, index: integer, test_file_path: string). You are allowed to execute this command for once only, unless it returns an error message, in which case you can try again with different arguments.
4. read_range: Read a range of lines in a given file, parms:(name:string, index:string, filepath:string, startline: int, endline:int)
5. express_hypothesis: This command allows to express a hypothesis about what exactly is the bug. Call this command after you have collected enough information about the bug in the project, params: (your_hypothesis: string)

## General guidelines:
Try to adhere to the following guidlines to the best of your ability:
1. Concrete Next Steps: Conclude your reasoning with a clear next step that can be translated into a command call, providing a tangible direction for implementation.
2. Code Modification Comments: When modifying code within a file, insert comments above the altered code, elucidating the change and detailing the reasoning behind it.
3. Understanding Bug Types: Recognize that bugs can vary, ranging from single-line issues to multiline challenges that may involve changing, removing, or adding lines.
4. Operational Constraints: Execute only the commands listed in the commands section.

## Simple Bugs patterns
Here is a list of some frequent simple bugs patterns:
1. Change Identifier Used:// Before int count = 10;
// After int total = 10;
2. Change Numeric Literal: // Before int timeout = 5000;
// After int timeout = 10000; 
3. Change Boolean Literal: // Before boolean flag = true;
// After boolean flag = false; 
4. Change Modifier: // Before public void performAction() { ... }
// After private void performAction() { ... }
5. Wrong Function Name: // Before void printMessage() { ... }
// After void displayMessage() { ... } 
6. Same Function More Args: // Before void process(int a) { ... }
// After void process(int a, int b) { ... }
7. Same Function Less Args: // Before void calculate(int a, int b) { ... }
// After void calculate(int a) { ... }
8. Same Function Change Caller: // Before calculateTotal(5, 10);
// After computeTotal(5, 10);
9. Same Function Swap Args: // Before processData(10, "abc");
// After processData("abc", 10);
10. Change Binary Operator: // Before int result = a + b;
// After int result = a * b;
11. Change Unary Operator: // Before int value = -10;
// After int value = +10;
12. Less Specific If: // Before if (number >= 10 & x == 1) { ... }
// After if (number >= 10) { ... }
13. More Specific If: // Before if (count >= 5) { ... }
// After if (count >= 5 & x == 1) { ... }
14. Missing Throws Exception: // Before void doSomething() { ... }
// After void doSomething() throws IOException { ... } 
15. Delete Throws Exception: // Before void processData() throws CustomException { ... }
// After void processData() { ... }

## The list of commands you have executed so far:
get_info , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'To understand the bug, I should first gather information about it. I will use the 'get_info' command to get more details about the bug.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Based on the information gathered so far, the bug is located in the method 'renderWrappedText' in the 'HelpFormatter' class at line 812. The bug is triggered by the test case 'testPrintWrapped' in the 'HelpFormatterTest' class. The bug seems to be related to a comparison failure. To further understand the bug, I should extract the code of the failing test case using the 'extract_test_code' command.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Since the 'extract_test_code' command failed to find the test file, I should try using the 'read_range' command to read the relevant lines of code in the 'HelpFormatter' class. This will help me analyze the code and understand the bug better.'
run_tests , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Since the 'read_range' command failed to find the file, I should try running the test cases using the 'run_tests' command. This will help me locate the bug and understand its cause.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The test case 'testPrintWrapped' is failing with a comparison failure. To understand the bug better, I should extract the code of the failing test case using the 'extract_test_code' command.'

## The list of commands you have executed so far:
get_info , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'To understand the bug, I should first gather information about it. I will use the 'get_info' command to get more details about the bug.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Based on the information gathered so far, the bug is located in the method 'renderWrappedText' in the 'HelpFormatter' class at line 812. The bug is triggered by the test case 'testPrintWrapped' in the 'HelpFormatterTest' class. The bug seems to be related to a comparison failure. To further understand the bug, I should extract the code of the failing test case using the 'extract_test_code' command.'
read_range , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Since the 'extract_test_code' command failed to find the test file, I should try using the 'read_range' command to read the relevant lines of code in the 'HelpFormatter' class. This will help me analyze the code and understand the bug better.'
run_tests , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'Since the 'read_range' command failed to find the file, I should try running the test cases using the 'run_tests' command. This will help me locate the bug and understand its cause.'
extract_test_code , Your reasoning for calling this command was: 'The test case 'testPrintWrapped' is failing with a comparison failure. To understand the bug better, I should extract the code of the failing test case using the 'extract_test_code' command.'

## DO NOT TRY TO USE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS IN YOUR NEXT ACTION (NEVER AT ALL):

**Important:** This is the end of information sections. After this, you will see the last command you executed (if you executed any so far) and the result of its execution. Continue your reasoning from there.

----------------- SYSTEM -----------------
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
// Express your thoughts based on the information that you have collected so far, the possible steps that you could do next and also your reasoning about fixing the bug in question"
thoughts: string;
command: {
name: string;
args: Record<string, any>;
};
}
